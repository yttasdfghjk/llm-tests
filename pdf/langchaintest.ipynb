The Noble Qur\\'ân is the living miracle bestowed by Allah upon \\nProphet Muhammad \\t and this, Allah\\'s Book, was \\nrevealed to him through the Ruh-ul-Qudus (Gabriel). Today 1400 \\nyears have passed and nobody has been able to change a single letter \\nor produce its imitation, as it is said in the Qur\\'ân (see Sarah HtIr, \\nV.15:9) and the statement of the Prophet .J_j \\tLo : \"Before me, \\nevery Prophet was given a miracle and they practised it during their \\nlifetime: e.g., \\'Isa (Jesus) used to cure the sick and make the dead \\nalive, etc., Miisâ (Moses) was given the stick etc., and I have been \\ngiven the permanent miracle of the Qur\\'an till the Hour is \\nestablished, so I hope that my followers will be more in number than \\nall the other Messengers\\' as my miracle will last till the Day of \\nResurrection, and it is a Glorious Book; when anyone reads it, even \\nif he is a pagan, etc., he is convinced that it is produced by none but \\nby the Creator of the heavens and the earth.\" \\n2. The splitting of the moon: Narrated Anas \\t that the Makkans \\nrequested Allah\\'s Messenger \\t\\' ,Lø to show them a miracle, so \\nhe showed them the splitting of the moon. (See SahIh Al-BukhárI, \\nHadIth No. 3637). \\n3. The crying of the stem of the date-palm tree in the Prophet\\'s \\nMosque: Narrated Jbn \\'Umar \\t that the Prophet \\nused to deliver his Khutba (religious talk) while leaning against a \\ntrunk of a date-palm tree. When he had the pulpit made and used it \\ninstead, the trunk started crying and the Prophet .L..j \\t went to \\nit, rubbing his hand over it (to stop its crying). (See SahIh Al-\\nBukhârI, HadIth No. 3583). \\n4. The flowing of the water from among the fingers of Allah\\'s \\nMessenger ,.L \\t (See SahIh Al-BukhârI, HadIth No. 3579). \\nNarrated Jâbir bin \\'Abdullâh \\t : I was with the Prophet \\nand the time for the \\'Asr prayer became due.

The authenticity of Al-BukhârI\\'s work is such that the \\nreligious learned scholars of Islam said concerning him: \"The most \\nauthentic book after the Book of Allah (i.e. Al-Qur\\'ân) is SahIh \\nAl-BukhârI.\" \\nImâm BukhârI was born on 13th Shawwâl in the year 194 A.H. \\nin Bukhârâ in the territory of Khurâsân (West Turkistân). His real \\nname is Muhammad bin Ismâil bin Al-MughIrah Al-BukhârI. \\nHis father died when he was still a young child and he was \\nlooked after by his mother. At the age of ten he started acquiring \\nthe knowledge of HadIth. He travelled to Makkah when he was \\nsixteen years old accompanied by his mother and elder brother. It \\nseemed as though Imâm BukhârI loved Makkah and its learned \\nreligious scholars for he remained in Makkah after bidding farewell \\nto his mother and brother. He spent two years in Makkah and then \\nwent to Al-MadIna. After spending a total of six years in Al-Hijâz \\nwhich comprises Makkah and Al-MadIna, he left for Basrah, Küfa \\nand Baghdad and visited many other places including Egypt and \\nSyria. He came to Baghdad on many occasions. He met many \\nreligious learned scholars including Imâm Ahmad bin Hanbal. \\nOwing to his honesty and kindness and the fact that he was \\ntrustworthy he used to keep away from the princes and rulers for \\nfear that he may incline to say things to please them. \\nMany a story has been told about Imâm BukhârI regarding his \\nstruggles in collecting HadIth literature. He travelled to many \\ndifferent places gathering the precious gems that fell from the lips \\nof the noble Prophet Muhammad \\t4i \\t . It is said that Imâm \\nBukhârI collected over 300,000 AhadIth and he himself memorized \\n200,000 of which some were unreliable. He was born at a time \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/Sahih al-Bukhari Vol. 1 - 1-875 English Arabic.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

Imâm BukhârI asked some of those who \\ninterpret dreams, and they interpreted his dream that he will drive \\naway the falsehood asserted against the Prophet _.j \\nSo it was a great task for him to sift the forged AhadIth from the \\nauthentic ones. He laboured day and night and although he had \\nmemorised such a large number he only chose approximately 7,275 \\nwith repetition and about 2,230 without repetition of which there is \\nno doubt about their authenticity. \\nBefore he recorded each HadIth, he would make ablution and \\noffer a two Rak'az' prayer and supplicate his Lord (Allah). Many \\nreligious scholars of Islam tried to find fault in the great remarkable \\ncollection - SahIh Al-BukhârI, but without success. It is for this \\nreason, they unanimously agreed that the most authentic book after \\nthe Book of Allah is SahIh Al-BukhârI. \\nImâm BukhârI died on first Shawwâl in the year 256 A.H., and \\nwas buried in Khartank, a village near Samarkand.
